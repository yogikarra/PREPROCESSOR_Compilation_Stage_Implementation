This project "PREPROCESSOR" when executed, performs three main tasks performed by the preprocessor stage of the compiler.
# Makefile
Created a executable file named "preprocessor" from different modules like main.c, rm_com.c, rp_mac.c, inc_header.c,....etc.., when executed will create a new .i file with filename ('filename.i') similar to the input .c file (command line argument - 'file_name.c')
